Please suggest the simplest open source license to use for a UC Berkeley project with no special restrictions, but for which credit should be given if it's re-used.

{"type":"think","think":"**Choosing a License**\n\nI'm currently focused on identifying the simplest open-source license for our UC Berkeley project. My priority is finding one that's easy to grasp and implement, meeting OSI approval while avoiding any intricate legal jargon or special restrictions. I'm leaning toward licenses that are straightforward to use and comprehend.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Simplest License**\n\nI've been honing in on the MIT License as the frontrunner for our project. It seems to perfectly match the need for simplicity and permissiveness.  While BSD and Apache 2.0 also fit the bill, MIT appears the most concise and straightforward for our purposes.  Attribution is the only real requirement, making it an excellent choice for easy adoption.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Choices**\n\nI've been looking closer at the nuances between MIT and BSD licenses.  While both are simple and permissive, I'm leaning back toward MIT for its sheer brevity. The research confirms that all three (MIT, BSD, and Apache) are prevalent within UC Berkeley projects. My investigation now focuses on identifying any subtle preferences within the specific departments or project types that might influence the final recommendation.\n\n\n**Identifying Recommendation**\n\nMy focus is now set on delivering a firm recommendation, considering Berkeley's licensing landscape.  I'm confident in proposing the MIT License as the ideal choice, based on its unmatched simplicity and widespread acceptance.  I'll also suggest the 2-Clause BSD as a very close second, underscoring its near-identical permissive nature.  I've checked UC Berkeley's common practices, and MIT fits seamlessly.\n\n\n"}

For a UC Berkeley project that needs a simple open-source license with minimal restrictions and requires credit upon reuse, the **MIT License** is an excellent choice.

The MIT License is widely regarded as one of the simplest and most permissive open-source licenses available. It essentially allows anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, with the sole requirement being that the original copyright and license notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This directly fulfills the need for attribution (credit).

Another very simple and permissive option is the **2-Clause BSD License** (also known as the FreeBSD license). Similar to the MIT license, it requires the inclusion of the copyright notice and the license text, but it also adds a clause prohibiting the use of the project's name or the names of its contributors to endorse or promote derivative works without specific prior written permission.

Both the MIT and 2-Clause BSD licenses are well-accepted, commonly used, and easy to understand, making them ideal for projects prioritizing simplicity while ensuring proper attribution. UC Berkeley's IP office also lists BSD licenses among those commonly used by the UCB community.
